After updating from WSL1 to WSL2, I had an issue networking within WSL2. I searched all over the internet and after looking far and wide. I found the answer. 

If you Symantec enabled on your computer, you need to change just one setting. Open Symantec Enpoint Protection, select change settings, under `Network and Host Exploit Mitigation`, click configure settings. In the pop-up menu, select Allow IP traffic"

Done!
