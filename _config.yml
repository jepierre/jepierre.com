user_description: I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for integrating hardware and software with several years of experience leading large technical projects. I'm a lifelong learner and tinkerer. I created this website as a cheatsheet for myself to remember all the tricks and tips I've gained over the years. I decided to make it public so that it can be helpful to others. My interests are in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Digital Image Processing, Robotics, Embedded Systems, IoT, SDR.
